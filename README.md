Controls: 
 * Click on blue arrows to navigate around
 * Click on coins and keys to collect them
 * Click on the door lock to open the door (key needs to be collected first)

Hint:
 * You better collect all the coins before entering the door :)

## What is that?
This is just a sample project made for [Udacity VR](https://www.udacity.com/vr) course.
The goal of the project was to get hands on scripting more seriously.

## Installation & Building
 * Open project in Unity 5.4.x.
 * Import [GoogleVR SDK package](https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/download).
 * Set platform to Android and build (it may work for iOS, but this was not tested)

## Binary
